I have helped teach graduate classes in linear regression and Bayesian statistics, as well as undergraduate classes in data analysis, game theory, and political economy of development.

Below is a selection of vignettes I produced for teaching.

## Bayesian Statistics
* [Count Models in JAGS/BUGS (html)](/teaching/countModels.html) [(Rmd)](/teaching/countModels.Rmd) - Note: The poor estimation performance for parameter r in the ZINB model is owed to ill-chosen sampling inputs. Changing the sampling inputs (length of chain, thinning, etc.) will most likely ensure that the posterior distribution converges. I thank Adam Kaplan (U. Minnesota Biostatistics) for bringing this to my attention.
