I have helped teach graduate classes in linear regression and Bayesian statistics, as well as undergraduate classes in data analysis, game theory, and political economy of development. See the teaching section of my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vkfellkg93vj8ww/CV_Derpanopoulos.pdf?dl=0) for more details.

Below is a selection of vignettes I produced for teaching.
