	<h1>George Derpanopoulos</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD candidate in Political Science and an MA candidate in Statistics at UCLA. 
		I study Comparative Politics (authoritarian regimes) and Political Methodology (social networks, machine learning). 
		In my dissertation, "Networks in Dictatorships: Essays on Economic Predation, Coups, and Dictatorsâ€™ Fate", I take a network approach to the study of three classical questions in authoritarian politics.
