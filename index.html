	<p>In my dissertation, "Networks in Dictatorships: Essays on Economic Predation, Coups, and Dictators’ Fate", I adopt a network approach to study three central processes of authoritarian politics: (i) economic predation by dictatorson elites, (ii) military coups, and (iii) dictators' post-tenure fate.</p>
