**Hi! I'm George Derpanopoulos**  

I'm a Manager at Analysis Group in Los Angeles, CA. Prior to joining economic consulting, I was a PhD and MS candidate at UCLA, where I conducted research on Political Economy and Statistics. This website hosts most of the research I conducted while at UCLA, as well as some of my teaching material.

Though I have moved away from the research topics and methodologies contained in this website, feel free to reach out if you have any comments or questions. Apologies for any delays in my response, as I only check my UCLA email periodically, and work commitments prevent me from devoting too much time to research.
