**Hi! I'm George Derpanopoulos** 

I am a PhD candidate in Political Science and an MA candidate in Statistics at [UCLA](http://www.polisci.ucla.edu/), where I study Comparative Politics (authoritarian regimes) and Political Methodology (social networks, machine learning). 

In my dissertation, "Networks in Dictatorships: Essays on Economic Predation, Coups, and Dictatorsâ€™ Fate", I adopt a network approach to study three central topics in authoritarian politics: (i) economic predation by dictators on elites, (ii) military coups, and (iii) dictators' post-tenure fate.
