I am a PhD candidate in Political Science and an MA candidate in Statistics at UCLA, where I study Comparative Politics (authoritarian regimes) and Political Methodology (social networks, machine learning). In my dissertation, "Networks in Dictatorships: Essays on Economic Predation, Coups, and Dictatorsâ€™ Fate", I adopt a network approach to study three central topics in authoritarian politics: (i) economic predation by dictators on elites, (ii) military coups, and (iii) dictators' post-tenure fate.
