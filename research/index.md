``Elite Networks, Offshore Assets, and Constraints on Dictators' Predation: Evidence from the Panama Papers" (in progress, to be presented at MPSA 2017)

Abstract: A large literature argues that autocracies can achieve high levels of economic growth if dictators can commit to not predating on elites. Extant research has focused on the role of *formal* institutions -- namely, legislatures and parties -- in constraining the dictator’s predation. Scholars argue that these institutions lower elites’ cost of monitoring the dictator, thereby making predation more observable and allowing elites to punish the dictator. I complement this literature by documenting the role of an *informal* institution, elite networks, in constraining the dictator. I argue that dense financial ties among elites serve to diffuse information on the dictator's policy, hence facilitating elite monitoring of predation—if the dictator preys on an elite's assets, those financially tied to said elite will observe the predation or experience its spillovers. In turn, elites affected -- directly or indirectly -- by the predation will coordinate and threaten to punish the dictator with capital flight. This credible threat can deter the dictator from economic predation and commit him to protecting elites' assets. Accordingly, I hypothesize that autocracies where economic elite networks are more dense experience less expropriation and enjoy stronger property rights. To test these claims, I uncover the network structure of elites' co-ownership of offshore companies -- a strong type of financial tie -- using the largest leak of such information to date, the Panama Papers. I find preliminary statistical support for my hypotheses using a panel of all post-1990 dictatorships.

``Factionalism, Communication, and Coordination: The Role of Military Officer Networks in Coups" (in progress)

Abtract: Why do some military officers participate in coups, while others stay in the barracks? Why are some coup attempts successful, while others fail? How does military factionalism affect coup dynamics? I tackle these questions through a formal model of coordination under limited information. In my model, officers only participate in coups they believe will succeed---coups where the expected number of participants exceeds their belief about regime strength. These beliefs are private, but officers communicate them to other officers in their social network. I model how the structure of the officer network affects individual participation in a coup and, ultimately, the coup’s incidence and success. A feature of my model is that coup attempts require the existence of a faction/clique--a group of officers who are all connected to each other--whose size exceeds regime strength. This is because, within a faction, there is common knowledge that all of its members expect they can coordinate to topple the regime. I explore the effect of factionalism--a reduction in average faction size--on the incidence of coup attempts. My model explains why the literature has been unable to show a consistent statistical relationship between factionalism and coups: because the effect of factionalism varies by regime strength--positive for relatively weak regimes, negative for relatively strong regimes--empirical analyses that pool regimes of differing strength will find a null effect. I test my theory using novel archival data on Greece (1945-1967). I estimate officers’ social network using information on their education and assigned positions--two officers are coded as connected if they overlapped in their studies or assignments.
