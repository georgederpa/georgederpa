[``Elites, Financial Networks, and Constraints on Dictators: Evidence from the Panama Papers"](/research/eliteNetworks_GD.pdf) (email for draft; presentations: APSA 2017, MPSA 2017, UCLA Graduate Student Conference 2017)

Abstract: A large literature argues that dictatorships can achieve high levels of economic growth if dictators can commit to not expropriate elites. Extant research has focused on the role of formal institutions—legislatures and parties—in helping elites constrain dictators’ predation. I complement this literature by documenting the role of an informal institution, financial networks, in constraining the dictator. I argue that dense financial ties among elites serve to diffuse private information on the economy, hence facilitating elites’ monitoring—if the dictator reneges on his commitment, informed elites are able to infer and punish his defection. This credible threat deters the dictator from predation and commits him to sharing rents with elites. Accordingly, I hypothesize that dictatorships where elites’ financial network allows for greater diffusion of private information enjoy stronger property rights. To test my claims, I uncover networks of elites’ co-ownership of offshore companies—a strong type of financial tie—using the largest leak of financial information to date, the Panama Papers. A statistical analysis of all cases during 1990-2015 supports my hypothesis.

[``Predicting Foreign Fighter Flows to Syria Using Machine Learning: An Introduction to Kernel Regularized Hurdle Negative Binomial”](link) with [Luke Sonnet](http://lukesonnet.github.io/)
  * [Replication material](https://github.com/lukesonnet/foreign_fighters)

Some countries have counted hundreds of their citizens fleeing to fight in Syria, while other countries’ citizens have remained bystanders? There are three methodological challenges to answering this question. First, there may be two groups of countries: one at no risk of ``supplying” foreign fighters and another supplying some positive amount. Second, there is no clear theory to specify the functional forms linking features to foreign fighter supply. Third, existing models perform poorly out of sample or yield output that is not amenable to social-scientific interpretations. To solve these challenges, we augment a hurdle negative binomial model with two machine learning tools. Namely, we allow our features to affect the response non-parametrically by using kernel functions that represent expansions of the data. Furthermore, we add regularization terms that penalize complexity to mitigate overfitting. Our approach combines the strengths of predictive and confirmatory models: it performs similarly to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in prediction while providing substantively interpretable output. Applying our model to data on 163 countries, we find that populous, developed countries, with a large Sunni population and proximity to Syria supply more fighters. These results lend themselves to viewing foreign fighter supply as largely driven by structural forces.

``Factionalism, Communication, and Coordination: The Role of Military Officer Networks in Coups" (in progress)

Abtract: Why do some military officers participate in coups, while others stay in the barracks? Why are some coup attempts successful, while others fail? How does military factionalism affect coup dynamics? I tackle these questions through a formal model of coordination under limited information. In my model, officers only participate in coups they believe will succeed---coups where the expected number of participants exceeds their belief about regime strength. These beliefs are private, but officers communicate them to other officers in their social network. I model how the structure of the officer network affects individual participation in a coup and, ultimately, the coup’s incidence and success. A feature of my model is that coup attempts require the existence of a faction/clique--a group of officers who are all connected to each other--whose size exceeds regime strength. This is because, within a faction, there is common knowledge that all of its members expect they can coordinate to topple the regime. I explore the effect of factionalism--a reduction in average faction size--on the incidence of coup attempts. My model explains why the literature has been unable to show a consistent statistical relationship between factionalism and coups: because the effect of factionalism varies by regime strength--positive for relatively weak regimes, negative for relatively strong regimes--empirical analyses that pool regimes of differing strength will find a null effect. I test my theory using novel archival data on Greece (1945-1967). I estimate officers’ social network using information on their education and assigned positions--two officers are coded as connected if they overlapped in their studies or assignments.
